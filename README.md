# Cardiovascular
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, highlighting the importance of early risk prediction. This project leverages machine learning (ML) models to predict cardiac disease using clinical and demographic data. Big Data tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark manage large datasets efficiently. Data preprocessing and feature engineering are performed using PySpark. ML models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, are developed with scikit-learn and evaluated via cross-validation. Data insights are visualized through Tableau dashboards, and a Streamlit-based interface enables user interaction. This approach supports early detection and can be scaled for routine use in clinical settings.
